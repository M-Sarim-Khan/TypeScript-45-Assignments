// Assignment:35: Animals: 
// Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
// • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
// • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
// SOLUTION:
let animals = ["Cow", "Sheep", "Goat"];
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(`${animal} is herbivorous animal.`);
}
;
console.log("\nAll three animals are herbivores, meaning they primarily consume plant-based foods such as grass, leaves, and other vegetation.");
