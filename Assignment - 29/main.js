// Assignment:29: Favorite Fruit: 
// Make an array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make an array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement such as You really like bananas!
// SOLUTION:
var favoriteFruits = ["Mangoes", "Banana", "Apple"];
if (favoriteFruits.includes("Mangoes")) {
    console.log("I really like mangoes");
}
if (favoriteFruits.includes("Peach")) {
    console.log("I really like Peach");
}
if (favoriteFruits.includes("Banana")) {
    console.log("I really like Banana");
}
if (favoriteFruits.includes("Orange")) {
    console.log("I really like Orange");
}
if (favoriteFruits.includes("Apple")) {
    console.log("I really like Apple");
}
